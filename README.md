#  Numerical Experiments Data from the paper entitled "Distributionally Robust Optimal Power Flow with Contextual Information"

## Goals

The purpose of this repository is to provide the details of the numerical experiments coded in the Python programming language used in the paper [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10592). This paper has been developed by some members of the [OASYS group](https://sites.google.com/view/groupoasys/home) through funding from the project [Flexanalytics](https://groupoasysflexanalytics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We encourage you visit the related links to know more about our research.

## Contents

This repository includes the data about the two test problems used in the paper:

- A 118-bus case study:

  * [118bus_case: This folder contains the data and codes (medium and high wind penetration case) used in the numerical experiment corresponding to the  118-bus case study with contextual information considered in [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07896). 

- Illustrative example (3-bus system) at the Appendix.

  * [3bus_case]: This folder contains the data and codes used in the numerical experiment corresponding to the Illustrative example (3-bus system)  used at the Appendix of  [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07896).
